# Early Prediction of Diabetes Risk

## Problem Statement

Diabetes is a major global health concern affecting millions worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling individuals to take preventive and corrective actions in time.

This project aims to develop a predictive model using real-world health data to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes. By applying data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques, the project demonstrates how data science can be applied to address important healthcare challenges.

## Objectives

- Analyze and explore patient health records
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for accurate model performance
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- Apply K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualize data patterns and model performance

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following health attributes:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (Target Variable: 1 indicates diabetes, 0 indicates no diabetes)

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

## Project Structure

1. Importing Libraries  
2. Loading and Viewing the Dataset  
3. Dataset Structure and Summary Statistics  
4. Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values  
5. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizations  
6. Feature Scaling  
7. Train-Test Split  
8. Handling Class Imbalance using SMOTE  
9. KNN Model Building and Hyperparameter Tuning  
10. Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

## Final Output

The project outputs a trained KNN classifier capable of predicting diabetes risk with high accuracy. Visualizations and evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of preprocessing and model selection techniques.

## Conclusion

This project reinforces how early-stage data exploration, cleaning, and proper model selection can lead to reliable health-related predictions. It highlights the critical role of machine learning in supporting clinical decision-making and preventive care initiatives.
